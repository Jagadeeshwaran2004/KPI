# KPI
In medical coding, **KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator**. KPIs are measurable values that help evaluate the efficiency, accuracy, productivity, and quality of the coding process and team

**Why Are KPIs Important in Medical Coding?**
**KPIs help:**
Monitor coder performance
Ensure compliance and coding accuracy
Optimize revenue cycle management (RCM)
Reduce denials and rework

**Common KPIs in Medical Coding**
**KPI	Description**
Coding Accuracy Rate	Measures how correctly codes are assigned (goal: 95‚Äì98% or higher).
Productivity Rate	Number of charts coded per hour or per day, depending on the specialty.
Coding Turnaround Time (TAT)	Time from patient encounter to claim submission (should be as short as possible).
Denial Rate (Coding-related)	Percentage of claims denied due to incorrect/incomplete coding. Lower is better.
Audit Pass Rate	How often coders pass internal or external audits without errors.
Query Rate	Number of physician queries sent due to unclear or missing documentation. A high rate may reflect documentation or training issues.
Cost per Chart	Average cost of coding each chart (especially for outsourced teams).
Coder Utilization Rate	Percentage of coder time spent on productive coding activities.

üîÅ **Sample KPI Targets (General Benchmarks)**
Coding Accuracy: ‚â• 95%
Inpatient Productivity: ~2‚Äì3 charts/hour
Outpatient Productivity: ~20‚Äì25 charts/hour
TAT: Within 24‚Äì48 hours
Denial Rate (Coding): < 5%
Audit Pass Rate: ‚â• 95%

**How to Use KPIs Effectively**
Regular Monitoring (weekly/monthly dashboards)
Feedback & Training based on trends
Performance-based Incentives
Root Cause Analysis for low-performing metrics
